# PyQt5 Calculator

This project is a simple desktop calculator application built using **Python** and **PyQt5**. The app supports basic arithmetic operations and features a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Percentage calculation  
- Positive/negative toggle (± sign)  
- Floating-point number support (decimal input)  
- Automatic formatting for large numbers  
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero)  

## Requirements
- **Python 3.6+**  
- **PyQt5**

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the source code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brkberber/Calculator.git
   cd repository-name
   ```
2. Make sure `main.py` and `calculator.py` (the Qt Designer UI file) are in the same folder.  
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## File Structure

## Future Improvements
- Add scientific calculator functions (sin, cos, log, etc.)  
- Better formatting for very large or very small numbers (scientific notation)  
- Dark/light theme toggle  
- Package as an executable (.exe / .app)
